“Time will tell” is a phrase used to convey the notion that if something is good enough, it will endure. Such is the case with the 1911. Its 114-year history proves John Browning’s design has staying power. There’s another phrase that applies to 1911s: “Adapt or die.” Only through adaptation can a pistol design thrive as technological advancements threaten its obsolescence.
Beloved for its ergonomics and unrivaled trigger, the 1911 was developed in conjunction with another of Browning’s marvels, the .45 ACP cartridge. Originally, the 1911 magazine held 7 rounds, which was more than revolvers of the day. However, by today’s standards, a 7-round capacity is anemic for a pistol. In fact, much smaller pistols often have more than twice that capacity.
The limited capacity of .45 ACP chambered 1911s, combined with the popularity of the 9mm cartridge, has led to the prevalence of so-called “double stack” 1911 pistols. While some double-stack 1911s are chambered in .45 ACP, most are chambered in 9mm, which allows for a higher round count than .45 ACP and affords you better recoil control. One of the newest double-stack 1911s on the market is 
Kimber’s 2K11
, which is available in both .45 ACP and 9mm.

Although Kimber has been manufacturing 1911s for 45 years, the 2K11 is their first double-stack 1911. Their popular KDS9c is a high capacity “1911-esque” pistol but is not truly a 1911, as evidenced by its lack of a grip safety. The KDS9c is a much smaller and lighter pistol than the 2K11. As well-designed as the KDS9c is, it doesn’t even compare to the 2K11 feature set. Few pistols could.

The 2K11 comes in Standard and Target configurations. Both are optic-ready and come with a C&H Precision adapter plate for red dots with the popular Trijicon RMR footprint. 
C&H adapter plates can be purchased from the Kimber store
 to accommodate optics with the Shield RMSc, Leupold Delta Point Pro, Aimpoint Acro, and Holosun 509T footprints.
The 2K11 Target
 features a serrated, adjustable rear sight and a red TAG Precision FiberLok 2 front sight, which provides a highly visible aiming point. If you’re familiar with fiber optic sights, you know that over time, they can become dislodged or break, but don’t worry – Kimber has you covered.

The 2K11 Target comes with an extra red fiber optic insert, as well as orange and green inserts. There’s even a black insert for those who prefer a more subdued sight picture, as is common when using a red dot sight, where having a brightly colored front sight could create a cluttered, confusing sight picture.

Since the rear sight is integral to the cover plate, when the cover plate is replaced with an optics adapter plate, there is no rear sight. While I prefer to have back-up iron sights (BUIS) on a defensive pistol, they can clutter your view through the window of the optic. And since pistol optics have become so reliable, with battery life that’s often measured in years, some are moving away from BUIS altogether.  
The Target model is further differentiated from the Standard 2K11 by lightening cuts in the slide and a one-of-a-kind Stan Chen Customs magazine well. For those unfamiliar with Stan Chen, he is a gunsmith whose pistols are works of art. If you want one, get in line. Fortunately, Stan Chen Customs also manufactures and sells top-quality 1911 accessories, like the mag well on the 2K11 Target.

Constructed of a stainless-steel slide and frame, with an aluminum grip module, the 2K11 is a big, heavy pistol that’s comfortable to shoot. With an overall length of 8.56 inches, a height of 5.74 inches, and a width of 1.4 inches, the 2K11 weighs a hefty 42.3 ounces with an unloaded magazine. To put to bed any capacity concerns, the 9mm 2K11 ships with a 17-round magazine and two 20-round magazines. The .45 ACP version includes three 13-round magazines.

The 5-inch stainless-steel bull barrel is fluted and ramped with a deep crown, 1:10 left-hand twist, and 5R rifling. It wears a highly polished DLC finish. 
The Target (OR) (optics ready) model I evaluated sports a brush polished coyote colored slide that is PVD coated. Unique, angled serrations at the front and rear are reminiscent of dumbbells. The mag well has the same serrations. As the name implies, lightening cuts reduce weight, but they also exude a modern, luxurious vibe. Although a departure from the original 1911 design, the 2K11’s external extractor enhances reliability.  
The 2K11’s black stainless-steel sub-frame is matte DLC-coated. The tapered magazine well helps stabilize the magazine during cycling. The aluminum grip module and mainspring housing feature matte Type III Hardcoat Anodizing. Grip texturing is aggressive without being abrasive. In contrast, the area below the trigger guard and the grip safety, which features a pronounced memory bump, is smooth.

The magazine release is textured to match the grip, while the ambidextrous thumb safety and slide stop are serrated to provide a solid purchase. The thumb safety is prominent and intuitive, without being in the way. The slide stop is large enough to use as a slide release. It’s easy to depress with your left thumb after loading a magazine, a technique that chambers a round faster than racking the slide. The beavertail and undercut trigger guard enable you to achieve a high grip for optimal recoil control.
A three-slot Picatinny rail provides room for even a large light/laser. Not only will a light ensure you can illuminate without compromising your shooting grip, but it also adds weight to the front of the pistol to mitigate the 2K11’s already minimal felt recoil impulse.

1911s are renowned for their single-action triggers, which slide straight to the rear, as opposed to pivoting at a hinge point like the trigger on a double-action, striker-fired pistol. But not all 1911 triggers are equal. The 2K11 Target’s aluminum GT Match grade trigger is one of the best I’ve used. Both trigger and hammer are skeletonized. The trigger, grip module screws, magazine well, and slide are coyote colored, which provides a distinctive contrast to the black frame, barrel, and controls.  
With a high-end double-stack 1911, aesthetics pale in comparison to performance. The 2K11 Target feels as good as it looks. Its weight and the feel of the aluminum grip module give it a substantial feel that’s well-balanced. While its size and heft make the 2K11 an unlikely concealed carry option, it would make an excellent pistol for home defense, competition, or even duty use.
A visual and physical inspection revealed the 2K11 Target’s fit and finish was on par with custom pistols, with some costing twice as much. Thanks to Stan Chen Customs, magazines funnel effortlessly into the mag well. The slide reciprocates smoothly and racks easily. I enjoyed handling the unloaded 2K11 Target, but I was jonesing to shoot it.

I mounted an Ameriglo Haven red dot and bellied-up to the bench, 20 yards from the target. (Although I would typically test the accuracy of a 5-inch barreled pistol at 25 yards, the indoor range relegated me to a maximum distance of 20 yards).
I fired four, five-shot groups with three loads of varying weights. The results were impressive. Group size ranged from 1.4 inches to 2.8 inches, with the overall average being less than two inches.
The trigger was excellent. It broke cleanly at 3 ½ pounds. Reset was short and easily discernible. Of the 2K11’s many attributes, the trigger press is what sets it apart. The trigger will enable you to shoot this pistol better than you might imagine. I consider myself a good shooter, but the 2K11 Target’s GT trigger made me better.

When firing offhand, I was able to run the 2K11 fast, while keeping the dot on the target. The pistol seemed to move back and forth in recoil and recovery as opposed to the muzzle flipping up, which slows you down and makes it more difficult to aim. When applying 360° inward pressure on the grip, you can hit your target with the 2K11 about as fast as you can press the trigger.
As you might expect with a heavy, 5-inch-barreled 9mm chambered pistol, the 2K11’s recoil is very manageable. The 2K11 Target is available in .45 ACP for those who prefer the traditional 1911 chambering but still want a double-stack capacity. The .45 ACP Target model ships with three 13-round magazines. It costs $100 more than the 9mm version. Both versions ship in a soft-sided, zippered case.
The 2K11 Target ran flawlessly for me, but if you have much experience with 1911s, you know they can be finicky when dry or dirty. The fact that 1911s tend to be more difficult to disassemble and reassemble than other pistols can lead to infrequent maintenance and ultimately, malfunctions. To simplify the process, the 2K11 uses Kimber’s patent-pending toolless guide rod.

If you’re in the market for a double-stack 1911, you owe it to yourself to check out the 2K11 before making a purchase. The 2K11 embodies the form and function Kimber pistols are known for and takes it a step further. Based on design, execution, and capacity, the 2K11 Target (OR) is much better than the average 1911. You might even say it’s twice as nice.
With an MSRP of $2,699, you’re essentially getting a custom double-stack 1911 at a significantly discounted price.  Like all Kimber firearms, the 2K11 comes with a limited lifetime warranty.
