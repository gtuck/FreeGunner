SDS Arms is excited to announce the launch of its 
Spandau Arms RL Bolt-Action Rifle
, chambered in .308 Winchester. The Spandau RL draws from the heritage roots of Spandau Arms, combining classic styling with a modern bolt gun experience. Built around a 700-compatible short action, this latest offering gives shooters access to decades of stocks, triggers, bases and upgrades developed for an iconic American rifle platform.
The Spandau Arms RL Bolt-Action Rifle was developed to provide hunters with a field-ready rifle that balances tradition and all-around performance. Boasting premium features and maximum aftermarket support, the Spandau RL stands out as a versatile platform that can be further customized to fit the shooter’s individual needs. Finished off with a Turkish walnut stock, the Spandau RL offers the look and feel of a classic rifle while providing reliable, modern performance. 
Featuring a 20” 5R rifled barrel with a 1:10 twist, the Spandau RL also comes equipped with premium features, including a push-feed action with an oversized bolt handle and AICS-pattern detachable magazines. With a #6-48 drilled and tapped receiver and a zero-cant Picatinny optics rail, the Spandau RL is optics ready. Its Turkish walnut stock has a 13.97” length of pull, with a durable oxynitride finish to protect against corrosion. Crafted to meet the demands of the modern hunter while honoring its legacy of tradition, the Spandau Arms RL Bolt-Action Rifle is now available through 
SDS Arms.
