GENESEO, ILL. (09/02/25) – Springfield Armory® is proud to announce the launch of a collection of newly redesigned SAINT Victors. Made up of 5.56mm rifles and pistols with 11.5”, 14” and 16” barrels as well as 16” and 20” 7.62mm rifle variants, these new SAINT Victors feature enhanced components and professional-grade reliability. The result is a full line of top-tier defensive AR-pattern firearms.
A recipient of the top “gold” ranking in the “Member Tested and Recommended” (MTR) program of the National Tactical Officers Association (NTOA), the new Victors are built on a solid foundation of forged 7075-T6 Type III hardcoat anodized aluminum receivers. Featuring low-profile, minimalist-style markings, they also feature the Accu-Tite™ tension system for an accuracy-enhancing fit between the receivers.
In addition, all these new Victors feature Radian® Raptor-LT® charging handles. Machined from 7075 aluminum and over-molded with high-strength, fiberglass-reinforced polymer, these provide ambidextrous functionality.

Out front, the new SAINT Victors feature 4150 CMV barrels with a continuous tapered profile, designed to deliver optimal heat distribution and rigidity. Featuring a durable nitride finish that provides a wear- and corrosion-resistant surface, taper-pinned/low-profile gas blocks and crowned muzzles, these barrels deliver both precision and reliability for demanding users.

The aluminum handguard features a full-length top Picatinny rail with T-slot markings, and ample M-LOK coverage for lights, foregrips and aiming devices. Free-floated for repeatable accuracy, the handguard is attached to the upper by a robust, patented mounting system with four integrated QD cups.
Topping off the muzzles of the 4150 CMV barrels are four-prong flash hiders, with the 5.56mm 14” model featuring a pinned and welded flash hider to bring it up to 16” in total length. Mid-length gas systems are featured on the 14” and 16” 5.56mm guns, while the pistols have carbine-length systems. The 16” 7.62mm has an intermediate-length system between mid- and rifle-length, and the 20” 7.62mm has a rifle-length gas system.

The enhanced bolt carrier group (BCG) is built from premium materials for ultimate reliability and features an M16-pattern carrier. The bolt is crafted from 9310 carpenter steel, HP/MPI tested, and nitride finished. A hard-chromed firing pin extends service life by reducing wear, while the properly staked gas key further ensures gas system reliability.

Rounding out the package in the new rifles are B5 Systems Enhanced SOPMOD stocks, Type 23 P-Grip pistol grips and polymer trigger guards, 45-degree ambidextrous safety levers, low-profile aluminum flip-up sights, nickel boron-coated triggers, and Gen M3 PMAG magazines. The 5.56mm pistol features an SB Tactical SBA3 brace. Colors offered include black, as well as Cerakote® Coyote Brown and Tungsten Gray models.
“Since its launch in 2019, the SAINT Victor line has proven itself as a market leader by providing premium features and impressive performance,” said Steve Kramer, Vice President of Marketing for Springfield Armory. “With these enhancements and updates, the new SAINT Victors — in 5.56mm or 7.62mm — stand ready to deliver professional-grade capabilities.”
