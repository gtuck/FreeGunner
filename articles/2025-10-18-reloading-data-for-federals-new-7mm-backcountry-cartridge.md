ANOKA, Minnesota – October 17, 2025 – Federal’s 7mm Backcountry is a new high-performance hunting cartridge boosted by all-new, patented one-piece, high-strength Peak Alloy case technology, which provides magnum performance in a standard bolt face rifle. Through 20-inch barrels and with 170-grain bullets, it can achieve 3,000 feet per second. Federal has recently published reloading data on its brand website’s product information page.

One of the marvels of Federal’s 7mm Backcountry cartridge is that it’s built with exclusive new materials and technologies, allowing it to perform far beyond conventional ammunition. And it retains that all-so-important ability to be reloaded. Earlier this year, Federal posted a short video showing the process as well as the performance of handloaded rounds.
