James Bond! While all of us know of this super spy, to gun enthusiasts it’s his Walther PPK/S pistol that gets a lot of the attention. The 
PPK/S shown here is the limited-edition Gold Ribbon Meister grade gun
.
Walther’s Meister Manufaktur program produces hand-built pistols with newly developed coatings and finishes not used on any of its production guns. Past Meister efforts have focused on the Q5 Match Steel Frame model, and this is the first such PPK/S.
The Gold Ribbon is also the first gun in the Meister series to be built in the United States, and “Walther Arms Inc. Fort Smith, AR USA” is engraved below the gold-filled Walther ribbon on the right side.
I would say the engraving on the slide is 100 percent coverage—to include the safety/decocker on the left side—with a floral motif that continues up and over the slide to the serrated rib on top. Behind the gold Walther ribbon on the left side it’s engraved “Carl Walther Waffenfabrik Ulm/Do. Mod. PPK/S Cal. 9mm kurz/.380 ACP.”

Limited Edition
The Gold Ribbon is fitted with a set of custom made checkered walnut grip panels with nice figuring. These are adorned with the Walther ribbon on both sides, and stainless steel screws with gold-colored escutcheons. There’s a slight thumb rest at the top of each grip panel on both sides, and the left panel is relieved around the magazine release, which is located high on the frame and behind the trigger guard.
The gun almost feels like it was made for me. At the rear of the grip frame, it is contoured from small to large at its base with somewhat of an arched design for comfort and to enable the thumb to reach the magazine release.
This is defensive gun, not a target gun, and the double-action pull is close to 18 pounds—although the single-action pull breaks at around five pounds. There is a loaded-chamber indicator located just above the hammer. When the gun is loaded, this pin will protrude.

Sights on the gun consist of a non-adjustable rear with a square notch and a front sight machined into the top rib.
Midas Touch
The Walther PPK/S Gold Ribbon ships inside a handsome leather-wrapped and stitched case with two luggage-type latches. The Walther logo graces the outside of the case, and the gun and a spare magazine are fitted in the softness of suede.
The gun’s suggested retail price is $2,499, and as you might expect, not every gunshop is going to carry the Gold Ribbon. Walther has a dealer locator on its website (
WaltherArms.com
) that’ll point you in the right direction.
