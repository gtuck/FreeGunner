Building the Modern Pennsylvania Rifle

Built entirely from in-state components, this all-PA rifle breaks the half-MOA mark, and represents the spirit of a commonwealth built on iron, wood, and accuracy.

September 24, 2025

By Frank Melloni

Although born and raised in New York, I have always had a deep connection with the state of Pennsylvania. Making the pilgrimage almost weekly for better shooting and hunting opportunities, it wouldn’t be long before my wife and I would buy a home here to capitalize on all the Commonwealth has to offer. We took a liking to the history of the state, particularly the parts that speak to the rifle shooter. Most of us are familiar with the legendary Pennsylvania rifle, but few comprehend how far ahead it was of the other long guns of its era. Although smoothbore muskets were the more prominent firearm of the time, they were seldom capable of hitting a solemn man in the battlefield outside of 100 yards. However, when placed in capable hands, the Pennsylvania Rifle could easily drop a single man at distances beyond 300 yards, a task proven at least twice by Sgt. Timothy Murphy during the Revolutionary War.
Murphy wasn’t alone in his proficiency at this time, as the state stood head and shoulders above the rest when rifle shooting was involved. Early into the turn, Congress tasked the colonies to build ten companies of expert riflemen. Maryland and Virginia were to raise two each, while PA alone had to get the other six. Congress’s faith in the Keystone was spot on, as not only did Pennsylvania hit the six-company mark, it had to petition for an extra three, as there were far more willing and able riflemen than anybody expected.  
The Pennsylvania Rifle itself is rather interesting, as it is the product of what, in essence, is the “big bang” of firearms development. It combines the right people, at the right time, with the right resources. If we wanted to consolidate the creation into a few words, it could be simply described as a mashup of the shorter, rifled, German Jaeger and the elongated smoothbore American musket. Getting there took the ingenuity of German settlers (who today make up most of the Amish and Mennonite communities) who observed the longer firearms that now surrounded them. Of course, ideas aren’t worth a damn if you don’t have the resources to build them into a reality, and that is where Pennsylvania shines. Home to the largest deposits of iron ore in the young United States, gunsmiths had plenty of metal to build the longer barrels and more complicated parts that comprise this rifle. This state is also one of the few places to have anthracite, a highly efficient coal necessary to fire forges. As for the stock, the state’s name literally translates to “Penn’s Woodland,” meaning gunsmiths had access to endless lumber, of which the finest was selected for their stocks.
Interestingly, much of what is written above hasn’t changed. Pennsylvania is still rich in iron, coal, and timber, and many of the same families responsible for creating the original Pennsylvania rifles still live here. The tradition of extreme marksmanship is also still alive and well, as evidenced by the 1,000-yard Benchrest shooting matches that take place outside of Williamsport, or the Silhouette shoots out by Ridgway. With that in mind, I pondered what a modern rifle might look like if it were built from components sourced from entities within the state. With their lineage and culture of precision, how well might it shoot? A cursory search revealed dozens of brands that call PA home—and many whose products are used by some of the highest levels of competitive shooters.

With options galore, I decided that I wanted a rifle that would embody the utilitarian spirit of Appalachia. The end result ought to compete well in Benchrest competitions as well as the more prominent PRS and NRL Hunter matches that have gained a foothold in the wider industry. However, I wanted it to retain its field expedience so that it could be useful in dispatching the distant groundhogs that plague the farmers of this state, and maybe even take a whitetail from a fixed position.
The Lock
Appropriately, the core of this build comes from the state’s capital. Based in Harrisburg, PA, Joel Russo of 
Terminus
 prides himself on their three-lug actions, which immediately get my attention. I’ve long been a fan of the shortened 60-degree bolt throw that comes with this configuration, as well as its more balanced lock-up. Best of all, they accommodate lefties, allowing me to cycle it with my trigger hand like everyone else.
Specifically, I went with the Zeus, which is the company’s most refined offering. I was drawn to its buttery smooth stroke, which is the product of the EDM cut raceways. This technology is quickly emerging as the premier manufacturing method for precision, especially when it is applied to pre-hardened steel, as it is in this case. A feature where the benefit is easier to see is its integral Picatinny rail. I have seen this component, when not integrated in such a way, come loose on several other rifles, rendering the rifle useless mid-match. In the case of the Zeus and other Terminus actions, this is impossible as it is one continuous piece of the receiver. Matching a stock to a Zeus is effortless, as it is built to the Remington 700 footprint, and adding a barrel is even easier. Built with a QD system, customers can simply screw in a pre-fit and lock it in place with a pair of set screws, making it effortless to rechamber or refresh.

The Stock
Selecting a stock for the build led me to a moral crossroads. Pennsylvanian hardwoods are gorgeous and plentiful, and finding a woodworker to craft them into a rifle’s cradle is a small task. However, as fitting as a wooden stock might be, it is seldom the path to top consistency. Humidity swells this material, changing the point of impact throughout the day, so non-organic options quickly became the go-to for serious marksmen. Mastering these is 
Bansner & Company
, located in Adamstown, PA. This is one of the most interesting businesses that I’ve worked with, as it is located only a few miles from the earliest documented gunsmiths in the state, Robert Baker and Martin Meylins, who are credited with making the first Pennsylvania rifles.  
Bansner & Company makes a plethora of composite stocks, each purpose-built for the rifle at hand. As mine was to be an all-purpose gun, Mark Bansner, the owner, suggested the HVT Carbon. This option mates seamlessly with Rem-700 actions and is comprised of carbon fiber for rigid construction without the bulk. Working directly with Mark was an exceptional experience, as having a direct line to the operation’s frontman was helpful.  This is the case for most of the other companies in this piece as well; however, the nature of a custom stock fit requires several tweaks and pristine communication. In our discussions, we decided to adopt the “at-home” bedding process, allowing me to experience one of the cost-saving practices that many of his customers utilize. Additionally, we modified the barrel channel and ejection port before it received a custom paint job.
All of B&C’s stocks can be made with the bottom metal of your choice, and I selected the Hawkins M5 Hunter DBM. It features a flush-fit mag release with spring retention, ensuring that you don’t knock the magazine loose accidentally. It accepts common AICS pattern mags, including flush fit versions similar to the one pictured here. Now, I will admit that Hawkins is not based in Pennsylvania, but I feel bottom metal is more akin to hardware than a component.

After all, I’m sure the screws and sling swivels are from other places, too. Even an internal magazine would likely use parts from outside the state (or even the country), so I let this one slide so that I could enjoy rapid, uninterrupted feeding.
The Barrel & Bang Switch
Several barrel makers have chosen to set up shop in Pennsylvania, again thanks to access to metal and other natural resources. I had a lot of choices here, but I was most intrigued by the latest to enter the fold, 
Geissele Automatics
. Located just a few miles from the historic Tun Tavern, Geissele’s facility is situated rather close to the birthplace of the Marine Corps, where of course “Every Marine is, first and foremost, a rifleman.” This is rather fitting as the company was started by Bill Geissele’s quest for the perfect NRA Service Rifle trigger. Since then, the company blossomed to provide the shooting public with several high-end offerings, now to include launch tubes for bolt-action rifles.
Something that I didn’t realize until I started spending more time here is that Pennsylvanians love 6mm cartridges, particularly the 6mm Remington. It’s to the point that you can walk into a gun store and ask for “6 millimeter,” and get slid a box of this classic, without any other words needing to be exchanged. On the same hand, 6mm cartridges like the Dasher, BR, and PPC have won high honors in the long-range competitions that started in this state. That being said, I wanted to stay in line with this notion, but wring more consistency and utility out of this build. All roads lead to 6 GT, and Geissele had a beautiful 1:7.5 twist blank for us to work with. Sending it to Mr. Russo at Terminus, he was able to turn it down to a heavy varmint contour, chamber it to seamlessly fit his action, and finish it to a threaded 24” final length.
While I was working with Geissele, they had re-released their Super 700 bolt-action trigger. This is one of the few two-stage offerings for Rem 700 actions and likely the only one capable of being converted to a single stage. Nearly every facet is adjustable, with a pull weight of less than two pounds being wholly obtainable. The combination of these features made it ideal for a rifle that will see competition, but will also see some time in the field.
Glass
A deeper dive into the “contact us” page of some popular optics companies revealed that many are headquartered in PA. The most surprising of these is 
Tract
, and I say this because I’m friends with and neighbors to one of the owners! Jon LaCorte started the company with Jon Allen as a means of bringing top-tier glass directly to consumers, eliminating the middleman. LaCorte resides close to me in Suffolk County, NY, but the business is located in Hummelstown, PA. I have never noticed because every time I needed a scope, Jon would simply hand it to me at the range. Ironically, the town has a history of clandestineness, as firearms production was quietly moved here while the British occupied Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War.
Tract was able to supply us with one of its new 4-25x Eagleman rifle scopes for the build. Its magnification range, combined with a reticle that features both MOA subtensions and a fine aiming dot, makes it well-suited for many different shooting activities, matching the rest of the gun’s theme. Tract also believes in the use of high-quality components, such as the high-transmission German Schott lenses, many of them made in, you guessed it, Pennsylvania.  
Finding targets at extended ranges is much easier when you co-witness a high-power scope with a non-magnified red dot; the Keystone state was able to provide this, too. 
Meprolight USA
 is headquartered in Middletown, PA, which is coincidentally where many of the revolution-era firearms made in Hummelstown went for distribution.  For this build, I went with one of their 
MPO-DF
s as its compact nature would be unintrusive, and it is built on a common RMR footprint, opening up several mounting options.
Mounting Solutions
The good news is that I didn’t have to use Pennsylvania tree sap to stick the optics to the rifle. Situated in Quakertown, PA, is 
Evolution Gun Works
, makers of some of the best scope hardware and firearms accessories on the market. Quakertown has a literal history of defending liberty, as the Liberty Bell was hidden from the British here for a short time during the war. Flying the state flag high, I used their Keystone series rings to mount the Tract Eagleman and the Piggyback system to affix the Meprolight MPO-DF to the main tube. The rings feature machined-in crossbolts, ensuring that they do not shift under recoil, and are comprised of 6160 aircraft-grade aluminum, making them as light as they are strong. The Piggyback system offers interchangeable plates for different footprints and can be rotated to accommodate dexterity or navigate around an optic’s features. In short, it was exactly what I needed, regardless of where they file their taxes.

Down to the Ammo
In the old days, each state made its own bullets. Today, that is still true, although the process is now more involved than merely melting and molding lead. True Pennsylvanian bullets can be sourced from 
Patriot Valley Arms
 , among other items. Located in Pottstown, PA, the area is rooted in the iron and steel industry, and its influence is easily observed within PVA. The bullets I chose for this build were their match-grade 95-grain Senecas, which are monolithic copper projectiles turned on ultra-precise lathes. While I was working with PVA, we also decided to incorporate one of their Jet Blast Muzzlebrakes into this build. This is a unique brake, as its specialized ports direct blast away from the shooter, and in most cases, can be installed without any tools.
While match-grade pills will offer the most consistent groups, they aren’t typically the most lethal. Therefore, I paired my work with 
 Lehigh Defense’s
 85-grain Controlled Chaos projectiles. Also turned from copper, these bullets are designed to expand upon impact. Although recently bought and moved by Wilson Combat, the company began in Quakertown, PA, and operated there for 20 years, so I felt they were still relevant to this piece, even if they are only rooted in the Keystone State.
Powder and primer were going to have to come from beyond our borders; however, I am proud to write that some of the best brass comes from here. Located just 30 miles from Pittsburgh, 
Peterson Cartridge
 shares the county with generations of metal workers who have now turned their expertise to building precise ammunition cases. As luck would have it, they introduced the 6 GT to their lineup in 2025, and I was one of the first writers to receive a batch.
Range Time
Putting together the rifle was effortless, as the manufacturers intended the union of these parts to be mere assembly, not gunsmithing. I’d like to write how I used my decades of knowledge and skill to guide my hands, but the truth is, anybody can put this rifle together, thanks to the efforts made by those responsible for getting the parts to me. To that end, I found myself quickly at a private range in Central Pennsylvania to start testing.
Beginning with some of 
Hornady
’s new factory 6 GT loads, I put the barrel through an abbreviated break-in, which was done more to settle the parts than to condition the bore. After putting a box downrange and cleaning along the way, I printed my first groups, which proved to be eye-opening. With factory ammo producing five-shot clusters that barely measured half an inch, I knew load development was going to be fruitful. Using Winchester StaBALL Match, I was able to cut things down to .348” with the PVA match bullets and .408” With Lehigh’s hunting pills. This is incredible performance for a rifle that I had just snapped together and will only improve as the gun sees some more wear and I experiment with other components.

As for the rest of the function, the rifle checked every box that I set out. Being chambered in 6 GT and outfitted with a quality brake made recoil rather palatable, and the combined efforts of Terminus and Bansner & Company led to trouble-free feeding that was inherently smooth. As expected, running the 60-degree bolt was inherently speedy, and getting follow-up shots downrange was rather snappy.
The Legend Continues
Building this rifle and learning more of the state’s history has been one of the most rewarding projects of my career. I am a sucker for tradition, and the further back it goes, the better. Fewer inventions are as American as the Pennsylvania Long Rifle, and seeing the values of integrity and craftsmanship continue to apply gives me hope that some of the other founding principles might still be alive and well, even if they are buried under some of the ugliness that we see on society's surface. In a state where iron, wood, and marksmanship have long shaped both heritage and innovation, my Pennsylvania-built rifle stands as the latest chapter in a story that continues to prove the Keystone State is still the heart of American accuracy.
