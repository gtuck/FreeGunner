The new Sako Model 90 Peak may be the best mountain rifle Sako has ever built. The Model 90 is an evolution of the already excellent Model 85, and while some changes are subtle, there are many, and each one is a worthy improvement.
One characteristic that the Model 90 gives up is the controlled-feed function of the Model 85 and certain iterations of the previous Model 75. Some shooters may be conflicted about this. Indeed, I am myself. Although you may argue the Model 85 was not a “true” controlled-feed action, it had many of the desirable characteristics of controlled-feed actions.
All that’s a moot point with the Model 90 Peak, as it is unapologetically a push-feed action—and a very good one. Let’s take a look at some specific improvements.

Peak Improvements
Sako 90 actions are an evolution of the 75 and 85 models. Joseph especially likes the low-set, machined-in scope mount bases that enable the scope to sit low and close to the action and barrel. (Photo provided by author.)
Most visible and possibly most notable, Sako opted to abandon its proprietary scope mount base traditionally machined into the top of the receiver rings. Instead, the 90 Peak features the best Picatinny rail-type bases I’ve ever seen machined integral to an action. Unlike nearly all other actions with integral Picatinny bases, these are low-profile and streamlined. They don’t perch atop the action like an afterthought. They’re tastefully machined nice and low. As a result, scopes may be mounted close to the action and barrel, which provides vastly superior balance and cheekweld.
Rather than having the old Model 85’s fixed mechanical ejector, which rides in a slot machined into the boltface at 6 o’clock (an impractical position required by the three-lug configuration), the Model 90 has dual spring-loaded plunger-type ejectors. The dual ejectors are drawn from the legendary TRG action used on Sako’s sniper rifles.

While I usually favor mechanical ejectors, this is a distinct improvement. Sako’s mechanical ejector had the tendency to throw fired cases against the bottom of a scope, which occasionally would bounce back into the action and cause a malfunction. The dual plunger ejectors heave fired cases straight out the ejection port.
Some chamberings, such as the .243 Winchester, have fast-twist rifling in their barrels. This not only enables shooters to handload modern, high-BC bullets that are too long to stabilize at traditional twist rates, but it also stabilizes monometal bullets more effectively. In Europe, where monometal projectiles are vastly more popular than in America, this is an even bigger consideration than the ability to shoot high-BC bullets designed for long range.
The rifle’s bolt features dual, spring-loaded plunger-type ejectors that are, according to the author, an improvement over previous Sako ejector designs. (Photo provided by author.)
Sako’s newly designed adjustable trigger is hands down the best I’ve ever used, in terms of how easy it is to adjust. To finesse pull weight, just insert a Torx-head driver through the petite hole in the trigger guard and into the trigger adjustment screw. The screw is click-adjustable and marked with dashes of varying length to indicate five different pull weight settings. I dialed the trigger on my test sample rifle all the way down, where it measured an impressively light 12 ounces. It’s nice and crisp, too. Trigger shoe position is also adjustable, but it felt just right, so I left it alone.
As with its predecessors, the Model 90 features a three-lug bolt with a fast-functioning 60-degree lift. Those three lugs ride in smooth raceways, which feature outstanding precision thanks to the fact that Sako broach-cuts the insides of the receivers.
Receiver distortion and flexion while firing are minimized by geometrically optimized shaping, particularly in the left side and top of the ejection port. The port itself is just large enough to allow effective top-loading (one of the unique and beneficial attributes of Sako’s double-stack, double-feed detachable box magazine), but it is structured in such a way that it prevents receiver flex. This directly benefits accuracy.

The bolt shroud covers the cocking piece, but a small tab of steel with a red warning dot protrudes rearward from beneath it when the action is cocked. Another red dot on the stock beneath the safety warns when the safety is disengaged.
The safety is a two-position lever positioned just to the right of the bolt shroud. When engaged, it locks the bolt closed and blocks the firing pin as well as the trigger, rendering it one of the safest safeties on the market. A small square tab just in front of it may be pressed to unlock the bolt handle, enabling the user to clear the chamber without disengaging the safety.
Under the Hood
The 90 Peak’s magazines hold five rounds of standard ammo and four of magnum cartridges. The unique design of the magazine release prevents accidental loss of the magazine in the field. (Photo provided by author.)
Sako’s bottom metal and detachable box magazine are the sleekest and most elegant I’ve seen. The trigger bow is beautifully contoured and reminiscent of the finely shaped guards on classic bolt actions by Rigby and Holland & Holland. As for the box magazine, it’s extraordinary. Flush-fitting and beautifully manufactured of steel, it’s quite secure from accidental loss—a feature that can’t be said of many detachable mags. To remove the magazine, one must press in on the bottom before fingering the latch.
This requires conscious manipulation and simply cannot be accidentally done in the field. I’ve lost detachable box magazines while moose hunting deep in Alaska and while mule deer hunting in Idaho’s Rocky Mountains, and let me tell you, a bolt action without a magazine becomes a very hard-to-load single shot. So I’m a big fan of the Sako design.
Sako carbon-fiber stocks for the 90 Peak are made with resin transfer molding (RTM) technology, which is a process used to create lightweight, stiff structures for aerospace use. Carbon filaments “…create a multi-layered 3D mesh structure” that results in a super light, strong, rigid stock. It’s temperature stable, impervious to changes in moisture, and naturally dampens accuracy-robbing vibration.
Being a curious soul, I took the action out of the stock and examined the bedding. From what I can tell, it’s created using a slave action rather than the actual action that will live in the stock. In fact, most of the bedding contours appear to have been created as the stock was manufactured, not machined out after the fact. It’s an intriguing method—and potentially very strong. I will say that the action-to-stock interface had a little more play than I expected, but the action screws torqued down beautifully, without any indication of slop or action tension.
Sako’s carbon-fiber stocks are built using proprietary technology, and the action beds in the 90 Peak stock are created during the manufacturing processes, resulting in a very strong design. (Photo provided by author.)
Stock contours are modern without abandoning classic, proven lines. I can’t help but feel like we’re currently in a rather Art Deco-type era of riflestock design, where function meets industrial aesthetics, with just a dash of class, and Sako’s Peak stock typifies that. Ergonomics are excellent, which is typical of Sako. There’s a slight palmswell. The profile of the pistol grip looks traditional but is actually nearly vertical. The comb is high and parallel to the bore, and it provides a good cheekweld. There’s much to like about the Peak stock.
A firm but flexible recoil pad takes the bite out of kick. Up front, the barrel channel is subtly free-floated all the way from the fore-end tip back to the receiver, ensuring that no contact will occur and compromise accuracy.

Sako 90 Peak rifles are available in a wide range of popular chamberings, ranging from .222 Remington to .300 Win. Mag., and with a variety of barrel lengths from 20 to 24.4 inches. And yes, you can get a Sako 90 Peak rifle in 7mm PRC.
My test sample is chambered for the 6.5 Creedmoor, and it has a 20-inch, match-grade, cold-hammer-forged barrel. The action and the barrel are stainless steel, and the tastefully profiled barrel features sleek fluting. Up front, it’s threaded with a metric M15x1 pitch. Don’t worry; each rifle comes with a 5/8-24 adapter, making it easy to install a suppressor with threads common in the U.S.
Before heading to the range to wring out the 90 Peak, I mounted a new Swarovski Z5+ 3.5-18X 50mm scope in 30mm low-height Seekins Precision rings. Thanks to the low integral scope rail, the scope’s objective housing fit gratifyingly low and close to the barrel. As a result, rifle balance with the scope aboard is perfect, and cheekweld is excellent. I put a Spartan bipod adapter on the front sling swivel, along with a Javelin Pro bipod.
Peak Performance
The 90 Peak’s fire controls are classic Sako. The two-position safety blocks the trigger, locks the bolt, and blocks the firing pin. (Photo provided by author.)
Sako offers an impressive accuracy guarantee stating that each rifle will shoot five-shot (not just three-shot) sub-MOA groups with premium ammunition. Since the 90 Peak is an ultralight mountain rifle (5 pounds, 12 ounces), I decided to shoot three consecutive three-shot groups rather than five-shot groups for the accuracy evaluation.
Right out of the gate the rifle shot sub-MOA averages. 
Hornady
’s Precision Hunter ammo loaded with 143-grain ELD-X bullets posted a 0.64-inch average on the 100-yard targets. Sako’s TRG match ammo loaded with 136-grain Scenar bullets was incredibly accurate, averaging 0.38 inch over three consecutive three-shot groups. That’s top-notch accuracy from even a heavy-barreled target rifle, let alone an ultralight mountain gun.

Five of the six loads tested posted sub-MOA averages, and two of the six (33 percent) produced sub-half-MOA averages. No flyers, no mulligans. Just stellar, consistent, reliable accuracy.
Five of the six 6.5 Creedmoor factory loads tested in the Sako 90 Peak averaged sub-MOA, with two averaging sub-half-MOA. The Sako ammo produced groups as tight as a quarter- inch at 100 yards. (Photo provided by author.)
Velocity was predictably slow due to the short 20-inch length of the barrel. It ranged about 100 to 150 fps slower than the same ammo out of a 24-inch barrel. As a result, this particular Sako 90 Peak isn’t the ideal tool for reaching far across the windswept prairie to drop a pronghorn antelope or across an alpine-country basin to take a mule deer. However, that short barrel is an asset when fitted with a suppressor. For work inside 400 yards or so, a suppressed Sako 90 Peak with its compact barrel is a fantastic little setup.
For high-country work (as the “Peak” in this specific Sako 90’s name indicates), I’d opt for a more potent cartridge and possibly a bit more barrel length. Yes, that would make it slightly heavier, but it would give it more reach.
Handling the lithe, little Sako 90 Peak is a pleasure. It’s responsive, points naturally, and balances well. The action is smooth and 100 percent reliable.
At $3,999 this is not an inexpensive rifle. If you buy one, you’ll be making an investment in modern innovation, durability, precision, and ergonomics. Discerning hunters buy a Sako for the same reason that car guys buy a Corvette—­you can get the job done with a lesser tool, but you’ll get a lot more pleasure out of using the Sako.
