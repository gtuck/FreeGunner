Top Selling Guns | September 2025

A new accessory may have helped catapult a gun to number one.

October 07, 2025

By Logan Metesh

The September edition of 
GunBroker.com's Top Selling Report
 presented by GunGenius.com, shows an interesting upset in sales trends, and it is likely due more to the release of a new accessory than to either the gun that has been upset or the gun that did the upsetting.
It’s no secret that the Glock 19 is one of the best-selling new and used semi-automatic pistols of all time. It has held a spot in the top ten of the Top Selling Report for a very long time, and in August 2025 it was the number one seller for new semi-automatic pistols. For September, it has dropped to number three. That in and of itself isn’t really a big deal as its placement has fluctuated and this drop is only two spots. What’s surprising is the gun that unseated it from the number one spot: 
the Taurus TX22
, which jumped up an astonishing 27 spots from number 28 to number one.
At its core, the Taurus TX22 isn’t a new design; it has been around for a handful of years now and it even 
won Guns & Ammo’s 2019 Handgun of the Year award
. The TX22 is an affordable pistol chambered for .22 LR that leaves plenty of money left over for ammo, even if you opt for the T.O.R.O. version and put an optic on it, 
with a compact version also available.
 What is new, though, is the introduction of a forced reset trigger that is compatible with the TX22.
A forced reset trigger is an aftermarket accessory available for a wide variety of firearms that forces the trigger to reset after each pull. This reset is done more quickly than is possible when done manually and allows the user to make quicker successive shots. It is very important to note, however, that the triggers still operate the gun as a semi-automatic with just one single round being fired each time the trigger is pulled. The sear will not continue to trip if you hold the trigger to the rear like on a full-auto firearm.

Made by Freedom Finger Triggers, the 22TY forced reset trigger is a little different from some of the others on the market that completely replace the factory trigger in the gun. Instead, the 22TY forced reset trigger replaces your factory disconnector. The 22TY allows the trigger to be reset upon the cycling of the slide, which allows for quick successive pulls of the trigger, while still maintaining one function of the trigger per round fired. If the forced reset fails, the pistol remains able to be fired in semi-auto. No other modifications to the gun are required.
Forced reset triggers are not new, but the introduction of the 22TY for the Taurus TX22 gives shooters the opportunity to do something that most forced reset triggers do not: shoot more quickly while staying economical. This type of trigger is available from a different manufacturer for the Glock 19, which is chambered in 9mm.
Ammo prices have fluctuated, and while 9mm is certainly cheaper now than it was four or five years ago, the fact remains that .22 LR ammo is still exponentially cheaper than 9mm ammo. Shooting a forced reset trigger in a Glock 19 is just as fun as shooting one in a Taurus TX22, but it’s definitely more expensive.

With the introduction of the 22TY from Freedom Finger Triggers, it comes as no surprise that Taurus TX22 pistols have become big sellers. Just how big they became, though, was definitely a surprise. Will the trend hold for another month, or will things start to return to normal as the novelty of another forced reset trigger on the market starts to wane? We shall see.
