Affordable Guns from Turkey: How They're Made

Turkey is home to many mass producers of the world's affordable imported firearms. We gave them a visit.

By Eric R. Poole

A part of me yearned to return since serving in the Middle East as a U.S. Marine, perhaps in the same way that draws some veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam to visit the sites of their battles. Though Türkiye, pronounced “Tur-­kee-­yeh,” is predominantly Muslim — and I a Christian — both religions have a historical presence in this region. Though business was conducted during the waking hours, we gathered in the evenings to exchange culture and celebrate each other’s company using the shared understanding of a few words to lengthen meals of seasoned steak, lamb, and chicken placed on colorful plates of fruit and vegetables, some pierced by skewers with tallow.
At times, a TV in the background was set to world news, soccer or a game’s highlights. This had little interest to me given that I didn’t understand the broadcasts beyond the weather and had to look at our hosts to determine who was winning the games. Despite the language barrier, every day ended late in a mutual reluctance to depart, with sincere gestures of friendship and respect. The meal’s host pulled his guests, one by one, into an embrace, connected by touching head-­to-­head or cheek-­to-­cheek. I struggled to remember the etiquette — right side first and then left — but I was quickly reminded that I had made friends for life, was always welcome to return, to stay with them, and encouraged to do so sooner rather than later.

By invitation, I visited firearm manufacturing facilities in Istanbul, the Beyehir region in Konya, and Trabzon. There were certain similarities regardless of brand: Cool marble floors and walls cut from the local mountains, chocolate on conference tables surrounded by comfortable chairs. Some offices were smoke-­filled, featuring ice breakers in the form of pictures, trophies and awards, and multiple Turkish flags ornamenting the surrounding walls. An assistant entered the meeting early to serve hot tea sweetened with sugar or a miniature cup of thick ground coffee or espresso. Glasses and cups were refreshed every 10 minutes, empty or not. Through our translator — Operations Manager Altan Ate of SDS Arms — small talk initiated a discussion of each company’s history and capabilities, followed by a trader’s discussion to negotiate quantities, price, payment and delivery schedules. Then came the plant tour.
The MAC 5 (left) and MAC 5K (below) are manufactured from original tooling and designs by Mertsav Defense Systems in a suburb of Istanbul. Mertsav employs more than 200 and operates three production facilities. Since 2006, Mertsav also makes machine guns, grenade launchers, infantry rifles and automatic pistols for the Turkish military.

Except for the manufacture of specialty parts such as springs, companies are proud of their labor and machining, always looking for ways to make processes more efficient. Whether it be shotgun, pistol, rifle or air gun, any detail is possible. The American importer only has to ask. Business is simple economics. The list of features is negotiated to a price that the importer believes will create a good value proposition for their customers. The manufacturer attempts to secure a certain percentage up front to cover wages, materials and overhead, while trying to sneak in some profit. The ATF came up in every conversation, including questions about current approval times for Form 6s, tariffs, estimated delivery times and balance payment schedules. Much of it was speculative.

My invitation to see Turkish manufacturing came through SDS Arms of Knoxville, Tennessee, a business owned by four investors, including Military Armament Corporation (MAC), Tisa USA, Tokarev USA, Spandau and Inglis. Under a “quality made affordable concept,” CEO Chris DiCenso joined me, escorted by Gaines Davis, a widower, professional engineer and 3-­Gun competitor who now spends half his year living in Beyehir and consulting with clients on manufacturing, quality control, and American design trends. SDS Arms is the only company I’m aware of that has three employees living and working in Türkiye to ensure America’s demand for quality are met. Davis deserves large credit as to why products such as the MAC 5, DS 1911s, and its sporting and tactical shotguns turn out as dependable and accurate as they are. SDS Arms products are generally spec’d to order rather than conceived and built by the Turkish maker, and all of its firearms are backed by a lifetime warranty. Davis’ end-­user insight, scrutiny of manufacturing, eye for detail and relationships contribute to the performance of these products. His bridge to the companies was best described when he said, “I have more close friends here in Türkiye now than I have in the U.S.”

I visited nine companies during my February 2025 tour, but there are hundreds of companies producing firearms for the world. The size of Turkish firearm manufacturing was surprising. In fact, Türkiye is the largest exporter of shotguns to the U.S. and the second-­largest overall exporter of firearms, according to the annual statistical ATF report “Firearms Commerce in the United States.” In 2020, Turkey exported 415,180 handguns, 29,450 rifles and 1,045,621 shotguns. Austria was second with 1,279,123 handguns imported that same year, and Brazil third with 1,016,630 total firearms. Of the Turkish importers, SDS Arms is one of the top three importers of firearms into the U.S. Other Turkish importers include Canik with a factory in Samsun and headquarters in Ankara, the capital of Türkiye; SAR of Sarsilmaz, Beyköy, outside of Istanbul; Tisas in Trabzon; Tokarev in Beyehir; Huglu in Hug˘lu; Stoeger in I˙stanbul; and Century with products purchased from MKE and Canik.
What follows are company overviews and manufacturing highlights experienced during Guns & Ammo’s exclusive visit.

Mertsav, İstanbul
SDS Arms sources its MAC 5 and MAC 5K pistols from 
Mertsav
, a company that has operated in support of the defense industry since 2006. Its product portfolio includes machine guns, infantry rifles, sniper rifles, rifle-­mounted grenade launchers and multi-­shot grenade launchers. Notably, it has also developed a bolt-­action chassis system featuring a three-­lug bolt design.
“Mertsav has a long history of collaboration with military tenders,” said Davis. “They now have interest in reaching the commercial market. They are our newest vendor and now have the top-­selling product.”

DiCenso added, “We’re very excited to be working with the preeminent manufacturer of military small arms, to be making our MAC 5 and MAK 5K roller-­block series and proliferation of well-­known models coming soon.”
Tokarev, Beyşehir, Konya
Tokarev
 is a family-­owned business that grew from producing garments to buying, selling and manufacturing firearms within Türkiye under the Salvador brand. Co-­owners Süleyman Alabog˘a, president, and Fahruk Tutal, CEO, purchased the Tokarev brand in 2019. Though they could (and have) manufactured the TT-­33 most associated with the name, Tokarev has responded to America’s demands for its bullpup shotguns, 500-­inspired pump-­actions, A300-­pattern semiautomatic shotguns, AR-­15-­style shotguns and lever-­action Model 1894-­style rifles.
Introduced in 2025, the TT-12 Pro features a competition-style layout with distinctive controls. Spare 5-, 10- and 20-round T-1919 mags are available at tokarevusa.com. (Photo by Mark Fingar)

In my observation, the manufacturing process flowed well through the facilities. With space available for expansion, Tokarev employs experienced masters and young engineers to ensure firearm knowledge is passed down to secure its future. Kadir Yıldırım, head of engineering, has worked at Tokarev for seven years and has studied electrical engineering for 12 years in Konya. Yıldırım is called “Usta,” meaning that he has earned the title “Master.” The strategy to secure its future is also present in its executive leadership through Seyit Mehmet Alabog˘a, son of Süleyman.

The gunmaking tradition in the Beyehir region was started 40 kilometers away in the village of Gencek. In the 1940s, a veteran learned how to repair guns in the military. Starting with single-­shot shotguns, a gun-­making tradition was created. Gaines noted, “Tokarev is eager to take all of the technical and manufacturing advice SDS Arms can give them,” which is how products such as the TBP 12 bullpup became a best-­seller.
Tokarev encourages engineers to improve existing products and develop new concepts. This engineer is working on a lever-action revolving carbine that’s near completion.
Most of the shotguns made in Türkiye are made in or near Konya. Among them is the company’s latest TT-­12 Pro, which is an AR-­style 12-­gauge shotgun developed for serious 3-­Gun Open Class competition where fast reloading is required. Its rival at the range is the Rock Island Armory VR80, which is made by Derya Arms in the Beyehir industrial park.
“Tokarev has been a reliable and consistent partner,” said DiCenso, “They are easy to work with — flexible and responsive.” Browning and Kalashnikov are familiar names in the firearm manufacturing business, and they are globally produced brands. Similarly, Tokarev has helped SDS Arms gain a significant share of the shotgun market since 2022.

Tayfun Özerbaş Makine, Beyşehir, Konya
“Özerba,” also known as “Typhoon,”
 was started by Tayfun Özerba in 2011. Typhoon is a sophisticated, multi-­level, and modernized manufacturing facility containing thousands of square feet of CNC manufacturing, robotics, development labs, and an indoor range. Known for its sporting shotguns, the company also manufactures pistols and AK-­style firearms not currently imported into the United States. However, it is SDS Arms’ source for the award-­winning MAC 1014 semiautomatic shotgun. More than 10,000 M1014 shotguns are produced annually. In fact, it has become so popular that a turkey-­hunting version of the platform is being considered.
G&A Editor Eric Poole smiles after evaluating the Tokarev TAR 12ODG semiautomatic shotgun in 12 gauge, a favorite among 3-Gun competition shooters. $350
Typhoon is also making the Spaundau S2 and the Agency M2/M4 Tradesman. In the case of the Tradesman, 
Agency Arms
 designed the accoutrements made for this platform. These guns were based on the legendary M1014 and M2 shotguns. The internals of the M1014 are gas and inertia operation, while the M2 is inertia-­operated only.
During the tour, Typhoon was proud to claim the best engineer in the region: Ömer Sayın. Sayın’s father was also a shotgun manufacturer who worked at several facilities. He was the initial designer of the MAC IX and worked on perfecting MP5 tributes.
Özerbas’ Typhoon Defence Industries operates multiple floors of CNC machines, robotics and injection molding stations, as well as an assembly area and indoor range.
“[Typhoon] is flexible and responsive, said DiCenso. “They have great expansion capability, too.
As SDS Arms continues to seek potential business opportunities and partners, we drove across the industrial park to visit Reximex.

Reximex, Beyşehir, Konya
Reximex
 owner and President Raif Sütçü is the brother of Mustafa Sütçü. Together they own and operate Kral Arms, a successful maker of rifles, pistols, shotguns and air rifles, some of which are imported to the U.S. by other brands. Raif maintains a small ownership stake in Kral Arms but is no longer participating in board meetings. Founded in 2015, Reximex is a comparatively young company created to manufacture air rifles, pistols and shotguns. It has also developed new bolt-­action rifle designs with a short 60-­degree bolt lift. Knowledge of the Turkish firearm manufacturing industry, combined with the latest in CNC machines and equipment and a youthful labor force means that Reximex is flexible to respond and quickly develop specific configurations of its products for its clients. It already produces high-­quality over/under and semiautomatic shotguns and competition air rifles, but this brand is one to watch for its new sporting rifle designs.
Kral Arms, Aüzümlü, Konya
Established in 1997, 
Kral Arms
 is known internationally for its air guns, pistols, semiautomatics, AK47 varieties and for making the first pump-­action shotgun in Turkey. Staffed by nearly 200 employees, it operates more than 130 CNC machines to manufacture 150,000 air guns, 100,000 shotguns, and 54,000 9mm pistols in 2024. To increase manufacturing capabilities, a new facility was under construction in the Beyehir industrial park during my visit. At the time, 80 additional CNC machines were already there. In the U.S., Kral Arms is known for making more than 50,000 pieces for TriStar. Though scalable exports to the U.S. are difficult, Kral has 72 partners worldwide including Air Venturi for its air guns. “You dream, we do,” is the company’s motto.

Huğlu Av Tüfekleri Kooperatifi, Huğlu, Konya
Hug˘lu — pronounced “Hoo-­loo”
 — is one of the largest and well-­known firearm manufacturers in Türkiye. Other than springs, Hug˘lu manufactures all its parts from material, including plastic and wooden components. It even does its own heat treatment and coatings. Of the 550 employees working two shifts, more than 230 are professionals with engraving or woodworking skills. Forty are hand engravers. It's shotgun-­making history started in 1914, although Hug˘lu Corporation was established in 1962. The company began with making a single-­shot shotgun before adding a side-­by-­side, over/under and semiautomatic shotguns to its offerings. For the past 42 years, Hug˘lu has been a partner of CZ-­Colt, which owns the Hug˘lu name in the U.S. It also supplies Mossberg. In addition to those shotguns, Hug˘lu manufactures select-­fire and semiautomatic 9mm pistols and is working on a bolt-­action rifle for SDS Arms.

Akus Silah Sanayi Ve Ticaret A.Ş, Beyşehir, Konya
The Inglis L9A1 is a historically correct configuration that serves as a tribute to the Hi Power issued to British forces between 1962 and 2013. MSRP $575
Akus
 was founded by the father of Fahti Akus and his brother, Halit. The company makes high-­quality, handmade, bespoke shotguns in low volumes. The staff are few but are seemingly all skilled artists and craftsman. In one corner of the facility, a 20-­foot-­high stack stretching 40 feet in length on two sides of an aisle contained the highest grades of walnut — with some blanks worth more than $10,000 each. The over/under and side-­by-­side shotguns made here are all hand-­fit and hand-­engraved. During my tour, I observed four women hand-­checkering full-­figured wooden stocks. I also made the acquaintance of Engraver Fahri Ag˘ır, who shared techniques while polishing and creating a relief of a field scene that canvased the receiver, triggerguard and hardware.
Akus makes Spaundau Premier Target and Premier Field over/under shotguns, which are imported through SDS Arms. Though Akus could make custom-­order products, the U.S. options are currently limited to barrel lengths of these models.

Akdaş Silah A.Ş. and Akdaş Outdoor, Huğlu, Konya
Selim Akda, CEO and owner, 
started Akda in 1998
. Today, more than 110 employees work 9,500 square meters of manufacturing real estate. With its indoor and outdoor firing ranges, the property spans 15,000 square meters. Akda Outdoor is operated by Selim’s brother, who makes sporting shotguns for brands such as SKB in the U.S. The Akda  brand is a family-­owned and -operated company who has been in the business of gun making for 77 years. 
Akda  is the only company manufacturing defense products for the Turkish army in the Beyehir. Its first was the MG3 German machine gun, a design derived from the World 
War II-­era MG 42.
“We are always seeking innovation,” Akda told me. “[For example,] our government started a new project requiring a grenade launcher in 2019. We made it, as well as the grenades, for the Turkish army. It was the first launcher for the Turkish army, and we delivered more than 14,000 units.”
In addition to its sporting shotguns, Akda also manufactures AR-­pattern rifles and semiautomatic shotguns and carbines. Among them was the SA-­9 semiautomatic submachine gun (SMG)-­style pistol in 9mm, which will be imported by SDS Arms as the MAC IX. The quality of these products is shocking, as was the full-­auto controllability and reliability of the SA-­9. The SMG market is about to heat up.

Tisaş, Trabzon
Tisaş
 was founded in 1985 in a garage to manufacture boutique firearms. Located on the Black Sea, there are cultural differences between Tisa and the manufacturers in the southern Mediterranean regions of Türkiye. Hence, the areas that SDS Arms sources products from provides a diverse perspective between manufacturing practices.
Business between SDS Arms and Tisa  began in 2016. The primary point of contact is Ergin Akyüz, who is the international trade manager. Most manufacturers have an international trade manager who speaks English, and Ergin was that person for us. However, he not only helped with translations but also in the understanding of cultural differences and mediating between companies.

Previously, Tisa only had business with TriStar. Of the five largest Turkish exporters, Tisa is number five. Unlike companies in the Beyehir region, Tisa makes more rifle products than shotguns. It has a tender with the Turkish government for 30,000 guns, including the new PX-9. Tisa is a privately held, multiple family brand. Unfortunately, Chairman of the Board Ahmet Alemdarog˘lu passed away during my visit. The company is now in the hands of his sons and the members of the board.
The manufacturing and modernization are efficient. In addition to some 300 CNC machines, several state-­of-­the-­art five-­axis machines, and robotic cells are operating as well. Since 2023, Tisa has more than doubled the size of its manufacturing capacity.
The PX-9 frames are outsourced by a molding company in Ankara. Tisa’ strategy is to manufacture the large components while maintaining control of small parts produced by Furkan CNC, also in Trabzon.
In addition to the polymer (PX) series — which includes the PX-9 and PX-5.7 — SDS Arms imported 84,999 1911s from Tisa, to include single-­ and double-­stack (DS) models, plus the Military Armament Corporation (MAC) line. Tisa employs more than a dozen engineers, who helped quickly develop variations of the Model 1911 and make SDS Arms one of the largest vendors of the 1911 platform. The Night Stalker series is an example of that collaboration.
“With more than 105,000
guns a year, Tisa is the largest partner to SDS Arms,” said DiCenso. “With them, SDS Arms has become the number two seller of 1911s in the U.S. in terms of volume.”

American Concerns
Türkiye earned its independence in 1923 and is a strategic ally to U.S. interests. In the last decade, it has integrated modern manufacturing standards to rival all other firearm companies in the world. As parts are precision cut and shaped, the machines at these factories don’t care where they operate. What makes products offered by SDS Arms different is that the company has employees in country, helping these partners focus on improving their processes and adapt to America’s changing interests and economy. There are nearly 200 firearm manufacturers in the Bey ehir region, but those working with SDS Arms are better off. Manufacturers such as Reximex are seeking out the attention of American engineers such as Gaines Davis to steady its business.
Though SDS Arms imports from several Turkish manufacturers, it employs a gunsmith and offers a service department at its Tennessee location. Every product sold by SDS Arms is backed by a lifetime warranty. If a problem can’t be repaired or replaced, they’ll offer an option for a new firearm. It’s a no-­questions-­asked policy.
What about intellectual property rights or patent infringements? These products are all tribute guns. As patents expire, this is what happens. (How old is the MP5 design?)
Do these employees get paid a minimum or living wage? Yes. Turkish firearm manufacturers are not exploiting anyone. Companies such as Özerba even offer employees two meals a day, time off for prayer and health insurance. I did not observe a sweatshop. Thousands of lives depend on these businesses to survive, while 35 employees in the U.S. depend on SDS Arms.
Does Turkey stand up to terrorism? Though politics did not come up, Turkey is a NATO-­member country and a U.S. partner. It continues to bridge relationships around the world, hosting meetings between world leaders.

With more than 300 firearm manufacturers, how do companies compete? On price and quality. There is an attitude of “frenemies” between competing brands, but each respected and referred us to visit other companies.
What about supporting “Made in America” policies? It’s always good to buy American, and SDS Arms is an American company whose business is to import firearms from Turkey. When you think of top firearm manufacturers, who’s on that list? There are a lot of non-­U.S. manufacturers because the arms market is an international one. Few exclusively manufacture every component in the U.S.
Produced by Akdas, the MAC IX 9mm demonstrated excellent accuracy and flaweless reliability at the range. An SMG-style pistol is offered by the Military Armament Corp. MSRP $833
Parting Shot
During a 3-­Gun competition, I was staged with two competitors faced with an array of steel targets. One was armed with a $2,500 custom shotgun tricked out with oversized buttons and a bright anodized receiver. The other was a shooter competing for the first time who had purchased a MAC 2 Tactical 3 Gun model for less than $500 — $461 to be exact. They were evenly matched. Every target received a hit and there were no malfunctions or fumbled reloads. Most importantly, the sport gained a new participant, and that’s something we all can root for.
