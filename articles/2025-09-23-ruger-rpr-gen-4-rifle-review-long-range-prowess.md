Ruger’s
 latest generation of its revered Precision Rifle, now in its fourth iteration, provides even more to the aspiring long-range marksman, with features that better support today’s shooting equipment and practices. At its core, the 
RPR Gen 4
 retains all the features that put the first version on the map—starting with the linear action that directs recoil straight into the buttstock, quashing muzzle flip. This allows shooters to spot their own impacts, a critical aspect of long-range shooting on the clock.
Inside the action rides a three-lug one-piece bolt, which is aided by dual cocking cams. This balances and spreads the cocking effort over a wider area, making it easier to keep the crosshairs on target through the bolt’s abbreviated 70-degree travel.
The RPR action features a fat bolt and short 70-degree throw. It accepts SR-25, AICS and even some M14 magazines for maximum flexibility. The gun ships with a 20 m.o.a. optics rail. (Photo courtesy of Frank Melloni)
The bolt is of a full-body design, which means the head is not wider than the rest of the shaft. This reduces binding and offers greater momentum when stripping rounds from the detachable magazine. The RPR uses Ruger’s patented Multi-Magazine Interface, and while the gun ships with a pair of 10-round SR-25 PMags, it can also accept AICS-pattern magazines and even some M14 mags.
While most shooters see this as simply a means of utilizing magazines they already have, there is a much bigger picture. Seating bullets closer to the lands is a typical practice for handloaders looking to achieve better accuracy. The SR-25 magazines don’t allow for extra-long rounds, but the more modern AICS magazines do. So if you plan on using factory ammo, enjoy the easy-filling, low-profile SR-25s. But if you like to tinker, there is a provision for you, too.

New Features
The chassis butt offers plenty of adjustment: length of pull, cheekpiece height and position and buttpad height. The settings are easy to change and lock securely. (Photo courtesy of Frank Melloni)
Among the new features, the Gen 4’s stock is likely to stand out the most. Like previous versions, it still folds to allow bolt removal. However, this generation’s is far more ergonomic and adjustable. A generous 3.5 inches of length of pull can be added with the press of a button. There is also a locking position to ensure this doesn’t happen inadvertently during a string of fire.
A conventional click wheel allows for cheekpiece height adjustment, keeping it in place under vigorous tension. You can also slide this component fore or aft to accommodate your facial structure. This is accomplished via a flush-set button that stays out of the way and can be reversed for left-handed shooters. Numbered serrations are provided to enable positive recall between different shooters or shooting positions. And the buttpad can be slid up or down to accommodate a shooter’s unique shoulder and neck geometry.
A big change on the Gen 4 involves the fore-end, which cashiers the old KeyMod slots and Picatinny rail in favor of M-Lok slots and an Arca rail. (Photo courtesy of Frank Melloni)
The new RPR’s fore-end represents modern advancements in the long-range shooting arena. A free-floating unit machined from aluminum, it replaces the old KeyMod slots and 12 o’clock Picatinny rail with M-Lok slots that cover its entire surface. More modern still is the Arca rail, which is fully integrated into the fore-end, ridding it of any hardware that might shake loose. The fore-end’s Smoked Bronze Cerakote finish matches the receiver and buttstock.

Each RPR ships with a pre-mounted 20 m.o.a. rail to make adding glass a cinch. For my testing, I chose a 
Leupold Mark 4HD 8-32X optic
. After locking it down in a Talley one-piece mount, I selected a variety of ammunition for my live-fire testing. As my sample was chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor, I had plenty of options. 
Hornady
’s ELD Match
 was an obvious choice, as competition shooting is the primary purpose of this rifle, but I also included some hunting ammo for those who carry guns like this into blinds and such. To that end, I also added the Black Hills ELD-X as well as 
Barnes’s Vor-TX loads
.
Accuracy
(Accuracy results provided by the author)
The first shot surprised me a bit because I wasn’t expecting a sub-2.5-pound trigger press to be dialed in from the factory. Because it can be adjusted in the field through the magazine release, I found that I could crank it down to a mere 2.1 pounds, so I did. Those who like a firmer trigger press will be happy to know that I was able to spin it up to just over five pounds.
I found the gun capable of sub-m.o.a. groups with each load, although the averages were at or just above one m.o.a. I ended the day by banging a 600-yard gong. The gun pushed straight back with each shot, and even with the scope zoomed all the way in, I had no problem spotting impacts. Ergonomics and accuracy are important, but for my money, this is easily the most important quality for a rifle with long-range aspirations.
Ruger has once again impressed me with a new product introduction. When students ask me for a recommendation on a precision rifle, the RPR is always among the few that I’m comfortable staking my reputation on. The advancements found on this rifle are squarely in line with current demands and only reaffirm my recommendations. These additions also stave off a lot of aftermarket customization. While one can easily swap much of the furniture and controls with items from the vast AR-15 aftermarket, if you ask me I think it’s better to leave well enough alone.
