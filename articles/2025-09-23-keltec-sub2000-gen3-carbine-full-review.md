In a world where it’s getting harder and harder to tell one gun from another, it’s refreshing to see manufacturers like KelTec challenging the status quo with innovative firearms like their 
SUB2000 pistol-caliber carbine (PCC)
. Introduced in the early 2000s and now on its third generation, the SUB2000’s claim to fame is its unique barrel assembly, which enables the firearm to fold in half. 
The SUB2000 GEN3 is currently only offered in 9mm. Mag catch kits enabled the SUB2000 GEN2 to accept magazines from Glock, Smith & Wesson, Beretta, SIG Sauer, and others. The SUB2000 GEN3 runs only on Glock 17 and 19 magazines, which are as abundant as they are reliable.

In addition to the folding barrel assembly, the SUB2000 family is characterized by its lightweight, minimalistic design. The polymer frame and barrel assembly are clam shelled together with screws. Highfalutin’ firearms enthusiasts may not appreciate the SUB2000’s industrial appearance, but I like it. A firearm is a tool. It’s OK for it to look like one. 
The pistol grip and handguard are just over an inch wide, making it easy for even small-handed shooters to acquire a proper grip. Weighing just 4.2 pounds (unloaded), the SUB2000 GEN3 won’t wear you out when shouldered. Its design facilitates rapid target transitions as opposed to a longer, heavier firearm where the tendency is to swing past your target.

The SUB2000 uses the familiar push-button style safety, but it’s in an unfamiliar position, high above the pistol grip. Its bolt group is housed in the buffer tube. The operating handle is easy to grasp. 
Although located on the bottom of the buffer tube as opposed to the left side of the handguard, the operating handle works like that of the venerable HK MP5. (You can use a modification of the MP5 slap to close the bolt). The SUB2000 magazine well is in the grip, resulting in a well-balanced, easily-controlled firearm.

The SUB2000 GEN3 received several upgrades — most notably, a barrel assembly that rotates left or right 90 degrees to fold closed, so you can leave your optic mounted. This, along with more subtle SUB2000 GEN3 improvements, has sent older versions of the SUB2000 into retirement.

Most PCCs, especially those with as modest a price tag as the SUB2000 GEN3 ($511), have lackluster triggers, making them hard to shoot accurately. In fact, the polymer trigger was one of the chief complaints about previous SUB2000 models. The SUB2000 GEN3’s aluminum trigger with upgraded springs contributes to a lighter, smoother, two-stage trigger pull of 5 pounds. 
The enlarged operating handle is not only easier to manipulate, but it also latches on either side as opposed to previous models, which only latched on the right side. The SUB2000 GEN3 also has a noticeably smoother operating system.

Other enhancements include the addition of a brass deflector, which can keep spent casings from thumping lefties in the noggin or ejecting them to the next county. The SUB2000 GEN3 uses a shorter grip to accommodate Glock 19 magazines. While you might not be a fan of a shorter grip, when you have a Glock 17 magazine inserted, there’s plenty to hang on to. 
The SUB2000 GEN3 sports a 16.15-inch carbon steel barrel with a 1:10-inch twist rate and a black oxide finish. It’s threaded ½-28 for adding a suppressor or muzzle device. Overall length is 30.45 inches, but when folded, the SUB2000 GEN3 is no longer than the length of the barrel. This gives plenty of options for storage and transportation. 
Since it is intended to be used with an optic, the SUB2000 GEN3 doesn’t come with iron sights. Rails atop and below the handguard ensure space to mount an optic like Bushnell’s TRS-26 seen here. With the PCC shouldered, I found the optic to naturally align with my dominant eye. Aiming couldn’t be easier.

Just because there’s room for accessories doesn’t mean you should weigh the SUB2000 GEN3 down with unnecessary gadgets. For defensive applications, I’d add a light and maybe a sling but nothing more. In addition to the extra weight, accessories expand the SUB2000 GEN3’s footprint, especially when folded. What’s the point in having a lightweight, foldable PCC if you’re going to bog it down unnecessarily? 
To fold the SUB2000 GEN3, ensure that it is unloaded and magazine removed. Press down on the back of the hinged triggerguard to unlock the firearm. Then, as you pull the barrel assembly up, twist it either left or right. An M-LOK slot on the handguard will align with the latch atop the stock to lock the firearm closed. 
To open, press the button on the back of the buffer. When you unfold the SUB2000 GEN3, rotate it so that the optic is upright. Pull down on the handguard until the barrel assembly locks solidly into position. An audible click confirms the triggerguard has engaged the barrel assembly. From there, insert a loaded magazine and actuate the operating handle to chamber a round.

Takedown and assembly of the SUB2000 GEN3 can be accomplished without any special tools. With the barrel assembly locked forward, verify that the firearm is unloaded with the hammer cocked and the safety engaged. Press the latch located at the rear of the stock completely then release the tension slightly to remove the stock pin with an appropriate punch or even the tip of a cartridge. 
Now, pull the operating handle to lock the bolt assembly back. Remove the buffer and recoil spring. Pull the operating handle down to remove it. Then, slide the bolt assembly out of the rear of the receiver tube. Lift the bolt head off the bolt. This is as far as you’ll need to disassemble the SUB2000 GEN3 for routine cleaning and maintenance. 
The blowback operating system results in the operating handle reciprocating when fired. (I was reminded of this when it hit my left hand during accuracy testing from the bench). Recoil is minimal compared to a 9mm pistol. The cheekweld and shoulder mount also make the SUB2000 GEN3 easier to aim.

The SUB2000 GEN3 is both fun and easy to shoot. It’s lightweight without feeling chintzy. From a bench rest, five-shot groups averaged just over an inch at 25 yards. Try doing that with a pistol, even one that costs four times as much. 
The longer barrel length adds velocity. The overall average velocity of 115-, 124-, and 135-grain bullets fired from the SUB2000 GEN3 was just over 1,300 fps. Increased velocity of a round fired from a 16-inch PCC will result in better terminal ballistic performance.

I’ve tested plenty of PCCs, and the SUB2000 GEN3 is the most fun to shoot. I didn’t experience a single malfunction during testing. While ideally suited to carry in a pack, the SUB2000 GEN3 is also a solid choice for home defense and would make a great truck gun. It folds in half for easy concealment and storage but is quick to deploy for defensive applications where a handgun may not be sufficient. 
New and experienced shooters alike will shoot a PCC like the SUB2000 GEN3 with more accuracy and confidence than a pistol — especially as distance increases. And with a retail price of $511, the SUB2000 GEN3 is probably more affordable than your carry pistol.
