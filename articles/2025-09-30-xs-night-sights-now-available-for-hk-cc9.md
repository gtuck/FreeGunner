Fort Worth, Texas (September 30, 2025) – XS Minimalist OR tritium night sights are now available for the HK CC9. Designed to co-witness in the lower fifth of the optic window of a direct mounted RMSc footprint optic, the Minimalist OR provides better visibility through the optic while still sitting low enough for use as a stand-alone iron sight set.
The Minimalist OR design is simple and highly effective with a self-illuminating tritium tac lamp in the front sight and a non-tritium, blacked out rear sight designed to drive focus to the front sight. Both the front and rear sights are serrated to eliminate glare, and the rear sight ledge allows for one-handed racking of the slide. 
Ideal for those who prefer minimal features in the rear sight, paired with a tritium front sight, the XS Minimalist OR is currently the only aftermarket sight option for the HK CC9.
“By collaborating with HK on dimensions and fit, we built a sight that installs easily and stands up to hard use,” said Jeff King, Marketing Manager, XS Sights. “Between the low-profile sight picture and the Black Nitride finish, the Minimalist OR delivers reliable performance and long-term durability.”

The Black Nitride surface finish on the Minimalist OR offers twice the corrosion resistance of traditional black oxide treatments, ensuring superior durability and long-lasting performance.
Retail Price: $109.99
XS sights are backed by a Limited Lifetime Warranty. The company also offers a 12-year illumination warranty on all tritium products. For more information, visit www.xssights.com.
