It was time again to make the sacrifice for our readers: endure the hike through the Vegas landscape: dry air, carpet dust, a million square feet of floor to search, all flooded with the latest respiratory plague variant. Yes, the SHOT show. In finding the latest suppressors for your briefing, I will tell you about them in the order in which I encountered them, so as to not influence you as to one or another being more awesome. Because they all are.
Rugged Alaskan Ti .360 
When you want light, and rugged, you can count on Rugged and their Alaskan Ti 360. (Photo provided by author.)
When you go to explore places where there might be bears, you take a bear-sufficient firearm. Okay, you can’t pack a 20mm Oerlikon, so you settle for a .338 WinMag. It is made of Titanium it can handle pistols and subguns up to 9mm (obviously) but it is also rated up to .338 Lapua Magnum. It comes direct-thread, but it can be built to work with 
Rugged’s 
own Ti QD mount. And when you do go and use it on a 9mm subgun or a .300 Blackout, it is full auto rated. It’s a lot at $1,800, but worth it.
US Armament 
The US Armament DeLisle carbine. As close to original as possible, but better in being quiet. (Patrick Sweeney)
When it comes to thinking outside of the box, the DeLisle carbine has to be a contender for first place. A re-built SMLE, in .45ACP, and integrally suppressed, it is the unicorn of suppressor firearms. Well, 
US Armament
 is now making as-faithful-as-possible copies of the DeLisle. Not exact, 
because we know a lot more about how to make a suppressor effective these days, so US Armament didn’t do an exact copy of the internals. What would be the point? But everything else is as close as possible to the originals, of which fewer than 200 were made. Who knows how many survive? Brace yourself, for such exemplary “I’ve got mine” status will cost you. But the bragging rights, at the gun club? Top-drawer.

Inland Manufacturing PM-22 
Rimfire suppressors are inexpensive, and a lot of fun. Inland is making their PM-22 for even less. (Patrick Sweeney)
The bulk of suppressor sales seem to be for rimfire, and for good reason, it is cheaper to run, cheaper to buy, and giggle-worthy fun. 
Inland
 is making the PM-22 at a weight of 3.5 ounces, and that is due to the aluminum tube and polymer baffle design. The threaded portion is stainless steel for durability, but the tube is just under one inch in diameter and only five-and-a-half inches long. The price is $189 (less than the tax stamp) and it works like a charm. There is one detail, however: the polymer baffle assembly has a service life, and you’ll need to send it back to Inland for the rebuild. Not a problem, at $189 MSRP.
Banish 9K 
The Banish 9K is more, and less. More titanium (as in, all) and less, as in no booster needed. (Patrick Sweeney)
The main problem with a pistol suppressor is the need for a booster. This adds weight, and also increases recoil. How to solve that problem? Ask 
Banish Suppressors
. They 3D print the Banish 9K, out of titanium, and thus make it so light it does not need a booster, and it is quiet, as well. The direct-thread mount is integral to the suppressor, so there’s no added steel of any kind. You even have your choice of thread pitches, the usual American ½x28 or the European M13.5x1LH. The total weight is a wispy 2.7 ounces. To keep it short, and quiet, they bumped the diameter up to 1.3 inches, but the overall length is just over four inches.
Jaguar Silencers 
The X Series are larger internally, by means of turning a tube into a tube with a basement. (Patrick Sweeney)
Okay, boxes are for storing things in, not shoving them into categories. The Jaguar series of suppressors come in two types, the Max Series and the X series. The X is the thing here. 
Jaguar
 uses additive manufacturing, 3D printing, to create their silencers. The X series are made as rounded rectangles to get as much expansion volume as possible inside the suppressor, and not make it a sewer-pipe-diameter tube. They are made for hard use, out of Inconel, and this means they are a tad portly, but, at just under 13 ounces for a 5.56 version, not the heaviest ones out there. Available in direct-thread or the new standard HUB thread pitch, they promise to outlast multiple 
barrels on your AR-15.

Aero Precision 
The Aero Precision Tephra is an effective rimfire suppressor that can do more than just 22LR. And it looks good, too. (Patrick Sweeney)
Fresh off of the Lahar 30 introduction, 
Aero
 has the Tephra .22 suppressor. Meant for those who spend range sessions knee-deep in brass, the Tephra has 17-4 stainless steel baffles inside of an aluminum tube. With its stainless baffles, it shrugs off .22LR, and can be used all the way up to a 5.7x28 pistol. At just under five-and-a-half inches, it isn’t ultra-compact, but it is only just over an inch in diameter, and you will not find your .22 firearm thrown off-balance by installing the Tephra. You can get it in Black or Kodiak Brown, and the list price is $375, which is not a big deal in the suppressor market these days.
Griffin Armament  
The new Optimus 6 is made for the growing number of 6mm rifles in use. It can be had in a variety of mounting solutions. (Photo provided by author.)
Optimus 6 is the name, and printed is the game. With so much long-range precision competition shifting to 6mm cartridges, using a .30 suppressor might be a hindrance. So, 
Griffin
 makes the Optimus 6. It is additive-manufactured, it is made to be used on 6mm rifles and it is made entirely out of 17-4 stainless steel. It is also almost an inch and three-quarters in diameter, for maximum internal volume. The front cap is tined for flash-killing reduction, and it can be had in one of the two Griffin Arm-ament mount styles, or the industry-standard HUB thread pitch. Your choice of Black or FDE Cerakote, coming soon.
Yankee Hill Machine 
The 12 mounts in the choke tube threads on your barrel for installation and you use a choke in the Victra to control spread. (Patrick Sweeney)
The 
Yankee Hill
 V12 is going to make quite the splash at the gun club. It won’t be making much noise, just a strong impression. The Victra-12 is a modular shotgun suppressor. You use the YHM Victra mounts and screw the mount into the choke tube threads of your shotgun barrel, and if you want choke, then you can do that at the front cap of the Victra-12. As-shipped, it is a twelve-inch package, because shotgun shells, despite not having a high chamber pressure, generate a lot of gas volume. If you want your Victra-12 to be shorter, then you use the rod kit and tools to bring it down to 10 inches, eight or even six inches in length. The rod kits are extra. At $995 and promising to bring the decibel level down to 135 at the shooters ear, this is as cool as it gets.
Dead Air Silencers 
The Dead Air Sandman X is the result of ten years of experience and testing. You want hard use, here you go. (Patrick Sweeney)
Working at something for ten years can produce spectacular results. 
Dead Air
 has their Sandman X, an additive-manufactured 7.62 suppressor, made out of Haynes 282 alloy. Haynes makes alloys for use in jet engine turbines, which is a harsher environment than a suppressor interior. The Sandman X can be had with different front caps, to adapt it to various calibers. It is rated up to .300 RUM, and it has the industry-standard HUB thread pattern on the rear. It is built for low back pressure, which is greatly appreciated, and you can have it in Cerakote, Black or FDE. It is full-auto rated, and there are no barrel-length restrictions. Depending on how many extras you order on yours, it runs from $999 to $1,059.
BSD 
This is a collaboration between 
B&T
 (who are making the suppressor part) and 
BSD Fabrication
. The rifle is an updated (but as close to original as possible) VSS Vintorez. The originals were made in 9x39, but sourcing that ammo here would be a 
hassle, so the new ones are being made here in the US, in… .300 Blackout. (I can hear the shouts of glee from here.) The suppressor is permanently attached to the barrel, so it is a one-stamp rifle, and that makes it even more cool. The display models were offered in two stock styles (still being worked out) a fixed and a folder. Price as yet unknown, but this level of cool is going to be pricey, but worth it.

Angstadt Arms 
The Angstadt Arms Reticent is not just a 5.56, but will be available in 7.62 and .36 as well. (Patrick Sweeney)
The new Reticent series from 
Angstadt Arms
 has been designed to produce the most sound reduction possible, but also to dampen the frequency output on each shot. The idea is to not just make it quieter, but to shift the sound so it becomes less identifiable, and on top of all that, it looks different.
Daniel Defense 
The DD SG-30TiL is longer and quieter, without being so much heavier that you’d even notice. (Patrick Sweeney)
The newest 
Daniel Defense
 is their Soundguard 30, improved. This the SG-30TiL. The “L” indicates that it is longer, being an inch and three-quarters longer than the regular SG-30Ti, and that means even more sound reduction. However, being made out of titanium, it doesn’t add much more weight, tipping the scales with 2.2 ounces more Ti than its shorter brother. Like the shorter SD-30Ti, it is rated from .223 up to 300 PRC, which covers a whole lot of rifles in your rack.
SilencerCo
The Scythe-STM is stainless steel, not Titanium, but that means it is a lot more durable. (Patrick Sweeney)
The 
Scythe-STM
 in .30 caliber is a stainless-steel version of the Scythe-Ti, meant for hard-use applications. This means no barrel-length restriction, and the STM is even full-auto rated. (The Scythe-Ti is not full-auto rated.) The STM is modular, so when you have it all-up, it is two baffles longer than the Ti Scythe, and when you shorten it, it is one baffle shorter than its Ti brother. Durability costs you, as the STM full length is 14.7 ounces, twice the weight of the Ti. But the STM can handle everything from .223 up to .300 RUM, and there’s even an included aluminum Anchor Brake.
Fischer Development  
The FD Suppressor mounted on an HK. No need for a booster, as the suppressor uses the accessory rail as the mounting location. (Patrick Sweeney)
One of the problems with putting a suppressor on a pistol is that you need an extended, threaded, barrel. Okay, two, since you have to have a booster as well. If you do not (with rare exceptions) the weight of the suppressor will “stall” the pistol in cycling. There are ways around the need for a booster, but there’s still the matter of the extended barrel. 
Fischer Development
 solves both problems. Its suppressor attaches to your pistol by means of the accessory rail. By sliding onto and clamping on the rail, they rigidly attach the suppressor to your pistol, without the need for an extended barrel. Since there’s no need for the extended barrel, nor the booster, they took advantage of that and made the suppressor a rectangle, not a tube.
This gives them more volume, to offset the gas losses you’ll have with the clearance needed at the muzzle. It also makes it easier to clean, since you can unbolt the side panel and get in to scrub the interior. Also, as a rectangle and not a tube, you don’t need suppressor-height sights. Your regular ones will work just fine. So far just for various Glocks, and the HK SFP9, but that’s a lot of what you readers shoot.
Kryon Suppressor Shield 
No, it doesn’t stop mirage, but it does keep your hot suppressor from melting your gun case, or scorching your leg. It will also cool off faster, as well, what with the airflow it gets. (Patrick Sweeney)
No, it isn’t a suppressor, but it is a saving-gear-from-your-suppressor accessory from Guntology that you might want. I mean, you’ll really want. Unlike your usual cloth wrapper to keep the heat from your suppressor from melting your gear, or burning you, the 
Kyron
 is a rigid shield. It uses an adapter hat that fits on the barrel, then you install the suppressor (or mount) and the shield. Your hot suppressor can’t touch, so it can’t burn stuff. Very neat. One drawback: it doesn’t knock down heat mirage. You can’t have everything, but you can keep your gun cases from melting.
