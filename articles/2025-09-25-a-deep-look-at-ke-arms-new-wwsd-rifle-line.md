The modern AR-15 is a far cry from Armalite’s original 1950s design. Its adaptations over the decades, while maintaining certain aspects of Stoner’s brainchild, have foregone some of his foundational principles, and the “What Would Stoner Do?” (WWSD) project seeks to reconcile that.
At its core, a WWSD rifle personifies what Stoner might have created if he’d had access to modern manufacturing and materials. While this won’t be as deep a dive into the WWSD concept as the series of videos on the InRangeTV YouTube channel, which explore the idea to its fullest and are a must-watch. I presented a few questions to Karl, the mastermind behind the build, to hear his take on why the WWSD is what the AR should’ve become.

Q: What are the project’s origins, and how has it evolved?
A: The project came about while I was on a trip for a shooting competition and acquired a used Colt SP1 sporter that was made in the early 1980s. It was essentially the pre-M16A1 equivalent of the original M16 but, of course, semiauto for the civilian market: Pencil barrel, 1:12 twist, no forward assist, etc.
It was incredibly lightweight, accurate, and wonderful to shoot, the opposite of so many “modern” AR-15 builds as well as the current M4 and M16A2. It made me think, “What happened to Stoner’s vision?” Thus, the WWSD project was born.

Q: A breakdown of key parts: Why were they selected?
A: The goal of WWSD was to bring the AR-15 back to Stoner’s original vision of modern materials and manufacturing, producing a lightweight yet still handy, reliable, and accurate rifle. There is a lot of nuance in many of the choices made, but the parts that really make the gun “sing” in this regard are the monolithic KE Arms KP-15 polymer lower, a pencil barrel, and carbon-fiber free-float handguards. While other components matter as well, those three really modernize the platform while keeping it incredibly lightweight and balanced.
Q: Which aspects differ most notably from off-the-shelf ARs?
A: It’s not obvious until you actually hold one, but the WWSD build (in all configurations) is unbelievably lightweight and balanced. It’s not just light; the balance matters as well. The internal components also apply here, such as the use of JP Silent Captured Springs. They let us avoid using a buffer detent (which can and do break), and the KE Arms SLT-1 FCG we use provides match-grade performance but with much higher resistance to dirt and fouling than most. Additionally, it can be on Safe regardless of the hammer condition.

Q: The forward assist seems to be disappearing on many modern ARs. Do you feel your design helped usher in this era?

A: Honestly, it’s hard not to notice how many AR variants have avoided the forward assist post WWSD introduction. Is it caused by WWSD or the work here at InRange? I don’t know, and I don’t want to specifically claim responsibility, but I do think it is a good thing. Stoner never agreed with it, nor do I, and it’s nice to see it be diminished. I’d like to think I had a hand in that.
Q: How do Stoner’s preferred materials compare to yours?
A: When Stoner started the AR-10 project and the subsequent AR-15 project, he was an aircraft engineer, and modern materials of that time were aluminum and plastic. We’ve merely taken that approach forward into the modern day with modern manufacturing, monolithic polymer lowers, and carbon fiber.

Q: Regarding weight, the WWSD is just right, being much lighter than most ARs. But can an AR be too light?
A: Yes, an AR can be too light. It can get to the point where 5.56 is more unpleasant than it should be. In fact, that’s one of the major complaints about the AR-10 in 7.62 NATO — it’s frequently “too light” for what it fires.
Q: The WWSD rifle makes sense as a hunting tool. What features make it ideal for this?
A: WWSD is as useful as any other firearm firing 5.56 for hunting, except more so in that it is a very accurate and reliable AR-15 that weighs less. While carrying it, which you do way more while hunting than shooting it, it’s easier and generates less fatigue.

Q: What has customer feedback been like from civilians, law enforcement, etc.?

A: Anyone I’ve ever dealt with or for whom we’ve sold one to or who has built one themselves is convinced that it is an awesome configuration. As I said, it needs to be held and shot to really understand how different it is.
Q: Two years post G&A interview, what has changed with the WWSD project?
A: Honestly, not too much. The original 2017 finished build and vision turned out to be pretty darn close to the goals. We’ve tweaked some things over time in who we source the barrels and handguards from, but the standard concept and build components have otherwise stayed the same. The original build was a 14.5-inch carbine with permanently affixed flash hider, but since then, we’ve added a variety of different configurations such as 20-inch builds.

Q: What all is offered in the current WWSD lineup?
A: Pretty much any configuration you want can be acquired through KE Arms, from 14.5-inch fixed muzzle device builds to full length 20-inch configurations. There are even ones with fixed iron sights and gasp ... if you demand it, you can even get a forward assist. I don’t recommend it, though.

Q: What can we expect for the future of WWSD?
A: It was intended to bring the AR-15 back to its roots: A lightweight, handy, all-purpose carbine made with modern materials and taking advantage of modern manufacturing. I feel WWSD surpassed all expectations in this regard, and many people who now use them agree. What is there not to love about an accurate, reliable 5.56 carbine that weighs less than 7 pounds (with accessories installed) and has carbon fiber as part of its design?
