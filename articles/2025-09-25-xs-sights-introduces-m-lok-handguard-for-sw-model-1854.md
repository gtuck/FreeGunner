Fort Worth, Texas (September 23, 2025) – The new XS Sights handguard for Smith & Wesson’s Model 1854 lever-action rifle (chambered in .44 Magnum with a 19.25” barrel) offers more customization potential than any other option on the market. With 28 total M-Lok slots, nine on each side and ten along the bottom, shooters have ample room for accessories without compromising the rifle’s classic lever-gun feel. The slim profile preserves the traditional characteristics that lever-action fans appreciate, while still providing modern versatility and comfort for a wide range of shooters. For those who prefer a fuller grip, optional cover panels can easily be added to increase width.
The length provides more barrel coverage than the factory handguard to prevent shooter contact with a hot barrel during extended firing sessions. The XS handguard also has the most durable mounting system on the market with a three-point attachment system for a secure, stable, and reliable fit.

"We designed this handguard with real shooters in mind,” said Jeff King, Marketing Manager, XS Sights. “It balances modern accessory options with a sleek, more natural fit that feels right in the hands. Whether you’re new to lever guns or have been running them for decades, our handguard gives you the option to customize the platform how you want.”
Made of aircraft-grade aluminum, the XS Lever-HG for the S&W Model 1854 is lightweight yet rugged and durable. This handguard fits the.44 Magnum caliber rifle with 19.25” barrel. Models to fit additional chamberings and barrel lengths will be introduced in the months ahead.
