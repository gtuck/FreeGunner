Choosing the best handgun for you isn't about gender; it is about finding a firearm that best fits your hands, lifestyle, and how you intend to use it. For most women, or anyone for that matter, this involves finding a fine balance between power, concealability, comfort, and a myriad of other factors that could potentially impact your purchase. You should feel confident in your choice, regardless of whether you are using it for home defense, personal protection, competition, or just an afternoon of casual shooting at your local range.   Below, we delve into a selection of handguns that have been proven time and again to be trustworthy sidearms, favored by the women who own and use them regularly.
Walther PDP F-Series

The Walther PDP F-Series of pistols is designed for shooters with smaller hands, with a grip that is not too slim, allowing it to feel secure without feeling too bulky. This striker-fired 9mm features a specially designed operating system that reduces the effort required to rack the slide. This is a benefit to everyone, especially those with limited hand strength or arthritic joints. The Performance Duty Trigger on this 9mm has a crisp break and reduced reach, ensuring effortless trigger finger placement.

The texturized grip provides a positive purchase on the gun without being too aggressive, making it comfortable for everyday carry. While there are multiple barrel lengths available, the 3.5-inch option is quite popular amongst those carrying for personal protection, boasting an impressive 15-round capacity. Lastly, the optics cut slide is ready for your preferred red dot, should you wish to forgo the gun’s stock iron sights. For more information, visit waltherarms.com.
Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 2.0 Carry Comp
After several years at the top of the market, the Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 2.0 Cwas updated with a compensated barrel to make it one of the easiest handguns to shoot in terms of reduced recoil. (Photo provided by author.)
The S&W Bodyguard 2.0 Carry Comp packs quite a punch into its micro-compact frame. Chambered in .380 ACP, this pistol is super light and easy to conceal, weighing in at a mere 11.8 ounces. With a width of 0.88 inches and an overall length of 5.85 inches, the Bodyguard 2.0 Carry Comp all but eliminates any worry of printing under your clothes. Ameriglo Night Sights come standard on this model, with options available for variants featuring either a manual thumb safety or none. The capacity of this micro compact is generous given its size, and it ships with a 10-round and a 12-round magazine. A big perk of this gun is that even though it is quite small, it is not "snappy" when shooting, unlike options offered by some manufacturers that are downright unpleasant to shoot. For more information, visit smith-wesson.com.
Ruger LCP
The Ruger LCP is one of the smallest, most concealable handguns on the market. This handgun has become a favorite for women with active lifestyles for concealed carry while running and hiking due to its lightweight design and ease of carry with countless holster options. (Photo provided by author.)
The act of carrying a gun for personal protection shouldn't have to take a pause when you go for a hike or work out at your local gym. While you may not wear jeans and a leather carry belt to go for a run, there are plenty of alternative carry options at your disposal. The Ruger LCP is an ultra-compact, lightweight gun with a footprint that all but lends itself to alternative means of carry. Whether you slip it inside a pair of purpose-built CCW leggings, a CCW fanny pack, or even place it within a holster for pocket carry, it serves as a reliable means of protection.

The Ruger LCP is chambered in .380 ACP and has a 6+1 capacity. The iron sights are integral to the gun's slide, while the hammer is recessed into the slide, all of which serve to provide the user with a snag-free draw. There is also a finger grip extension floorplate available, which can be added to the bottom of the magazine, providing an additional grip surface and improved grip.

Glock 43X MOS

If you're the type of person who loves to tinker around with things and would prefer to have the option to customize your gun to your heart's content, the Glock 43X MOS is right up your alley. This subcompact 9mm features a minimized profile, making it popular for concealed carry. The optics cut slide caters to those who prefer red dots on their handguns, while many keep it simple and choose to utilize the incorporated irons. This pistol features a ten-round capacity, a built-in beavertail, and a reversible magazine catch, allowing left-handed shooters to easily switch it from its right-handed configuration. Lastly, the slide on the 43XMOS sports cleverly placed serrations, making slide manipulation a breeze. For more information, visit us.glock.com.
Taurus GX4

The Taurus GX4 is a micro-compact 9mm handgun designed for concealed carry, measuring 4.40 inches in overall height, 6.05 inches in overall length, and 1.08 inches in overall width. This model features a flat-faced, serrated trigger for improved control and a reversible magazine release for those seeking ambidextrous use. This striker-fired 9mm pistol features a ten-round capacity and ships with iron sights. A T.O.R.O. variant is also available, which includes an optics cut slide. Regardless of which option you choose, the Taurus GX4 is a reliable, budget-friendly option perfect for CCW or even some well-earned training sessions at your local range.

Sig P365 Rose

This special edition micro-compact handgun was designed in collaboration with champion shooter Lena Miculek, to inspire and empower fellow women through proper training, education, and a sense of community. This handgun is chambered in .380 ACP and features an optics-ready slide, a laser-engraved grip module, and matte rose gold accents, providing a stylish aesthetic that is neither over-the-top nor understated. The P365 Rose ships as a kit that includes two 10-round magazines, day/night sights, a pistol safe, dummy rounds, and access to online training and a community of fellow P365 Rose owners.
