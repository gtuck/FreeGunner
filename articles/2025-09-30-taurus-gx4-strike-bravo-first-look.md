By Taurus Press Release

The Taurus 
GX4 Strike Bravo
 serves as an exciting new option in the popular 9mm GX4 family. Developed in partnership with Strike Industries, the GX4 Strike Bravo combines compact carry performance with enhanced tactical stability to deliver accuracy and confidence at longer ranges.
The GX4 Strike Bravo features a new chassis and modular grip system co-developed with Strike Industries, specifically engineered to accept the Strike Industries FSA Single Stabilizer. This folding brace system provides increased stability, improved length of pull, and greater surface contact for shooters. The result is greater control, improved shootability, and enhanced precision compared to a standalone handgun — all while preserving the GX4’s compact footprint.
Key features of the Taurus GX4 Strike Bravo include:
Collaborative Chassis & Modular Grip Design: Engineered with Strike Industries for seamless brace integration.
Optic-Ready TORO (Taurus Optic Ready Option) Slide for red-dot compatibility.
½ x 28 Threaded Barrel ready to accept suppressors or aftermarket muzzle devices.
Reversible Charging Handle for a customizable setup.
MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rail for lights, lasers, and other accessories.
X4 Platform Compatibility with existing magazines, basepads, barrels, and accessories.
“The GX4 Strike Bravo is Taurus stepping in a bold new direction,” said Laura Prieto, Marketing Manager. “By teaming up with Strike Industries, we didn’t just add a brace — we co-engineered a dedicated chassis and modular grip system to support it. That collaboration created an affordable, compact pistol that offers shooters extra stability, control, and versatility — expanding what they can expect from the GX4 family!”
